# Library-Management-System
Manual process of keeping student records, book records, is very difficult.
There are various problems faced by the student and librarian in the library such
as finding any particular book, information whether a book is available or not,
for what time this book will be available, searching for books etc. To eliminate
this manual system, the Library Management System (LMS) has been
developed. It will handle all the current issues faced by the students and by its
admin personnel.
 In this project we have tried to maintain the record and retrieve the details of
books available in the library, which mainly focuses on basic operations in a
library like adding new members, new books, searching books and allowing
members to borrow and return books.
This LMS will provide additional flexibility and convenience to the library
users, help in better reliability and security of the library information, will give
a more productive environment for the library staff members and also reduce
the cost of the library operations.
